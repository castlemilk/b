This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I've used the [Gatsby base blog template here](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). With styling, tuning and components taken from the incredibly impressive blog done by [Dan Abramov](https://mobile.twitter.com/dan_abramov) called [overreacted.io](overreacted.io).

The goals of this medium is to explore ideas in an open format to hopefully act as a mechanism for clean note taking but also encouraging more structured exploration of technologies. I would like to play with different technology and write posts here capturing the learnings for my own future reference. I'd like to continually update/clean blog posts overtime, further refining ideas, almost like a personal wiki.
