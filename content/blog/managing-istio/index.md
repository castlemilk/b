# Introduction

Having run a number of production grade clusters in different environments, there's a patterns that I've seen emerge from the running, developing and testing Istio **Service Mesh**. This post will focus on some of the common configuration patterns for enabling the following:

* **ingress** -
* **egress** -
* **end user authentication (JWT)** -
* **RBAC** -
* **Telemetry configuration** -

Istio is a fairly complex beast, consisting of a number of components for the control-plane, which primarily serve the function of managing the pushing of configuration to our Envoy sidecars.

## Pilot

## Mixer

### Telemetry

### Policy

## Envoy - Sidecars

## Envoy - Gateways

## Security
